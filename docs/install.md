# Installation

Imposter can be installed on Linux, macOS and Windows.

> If you're looking to upgrade Imposter, see [Upgrade](./upgrade.md).

## Prerequisites

Imposter supports different mock engine types: Docker (default) and JVM. For more information about configuring the engine type see:

- [Docker engine](./docker_engine.md) (default)
- [JVM engine](./jvm_engine.md)

**You must have at least one of the engine types configured to use Imposter.**

## Quick start

Use these instructions to get up and running quickly.

### Homebrew

If you have Homebrew installed:

    brew tap gatehill/imposter
    brew install imposter

### Shell script

Or, use this one liner (macOS and Linux only):

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imposter-project/imposter-cli/main/install/install_imposter.sh | bash -
```

> **Warning**
> It is good practice to examine [the script](../install/install_imposter.sh) first.

See [Releases](https://github.com/imposter-project/imposter-cli/releases) for the latest version.
