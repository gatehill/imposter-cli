var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "imposter",
	Short: "Imposter mock engine CLI",
	Long: `Imposter is a scriptable, multipurpose mock server.
Use Imposter to:

* run standalone mocks in place of real systems
* turn an OpenAPI/Swagger file into a mock API for testing or QA
* quickly set up a temporary API for your mobile/web client teams whilst the real API is being built
* decouple your integration tests from the cloud/various back-end systems and take control of your dependencies
* validate your API requests against an OpenAPI specification

Provide mock responses using static files or customise behaviour based on characteristics of the request.
Capture data and use response templates to provide conditional responses.

Power users can control mock responses with JavaScript or Java/Groovy script engines.
Advanced users can write their own plugins in a JVM language of their choice.
