# Imposter: Scriptable, multipurpose mock server

Reliable, scriptable and extensible mock server for REST APIs, OpenAPI (and Swagger) specifications, SOAP/WSDL Web Services, Salesforce and HBase APIs.

> This project is the CLI tool for the [Imposter mock engine](https://www.imposter.sh).

Start a live mock of an OpenAPI specification with just:

```shell
$ imposter up -s

found 1 OpenAPI spec(s)
starting server on port 8080...
...
mock server up and running at http://localhost:8080
```

You now have a live mock of your OpenAPI spec running on localhost.

---

Or create a mock by proxying an exising endpoint:

```shell
$ imposter proxy https://example.com

starting proxy on port 8080
...
wrote response file /users.json for request GET /users
wrote config file example.com-config.yaml
```

Once you've recorded the HTTP exchanges, just run `imposter up` to start your mock. 

---

Or create a mock from an existing OpenAPI file:

```shell
$ imposter scaffold

found 1 OpenAPI spec(s)
generated 1 resources from spec
wrote Imposter config: /Users/mary/example/petstore-config.yaml
```

Just run `imposter up` to start your mock.

## Features

- run standalone mocks in place of real systems
- turn an OpenAPI/Swagger file into a mock API for testing or QA (even before the real API is built)
- decouple your integration tests from the cloud/various back-end systems and take control of your dependencies
- validate your API requests against an OpenAPI specification
- capture data and validate later or use response templates to provide conditional responses
- proxy an existing endpoint to replay its responses as a mock

Send dynamic responses:

- Provide mock responses using static files or customise behaviour based on characteristics of the request.
- Power users can control mock responses with JavaScript or Java/Groovy script engines.
- Advanced users can write their own plugins in a JVM language of their choice.

## Getting started & documentation

You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running, or if Docker is not available, you can run on the [JVM](./docs/jvm_engine.md).

### Installation

See the [Installation](./docs/install.md) instructions for your system or follow the quick-start instructions below:

#### Homebrew

If you have Homebrew installed:

    brew tap gatehill/imposter
    brew install imposter

#### Shell script

Or, use this one liner (macOS and Linux only):

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gatehill/imposter-cli/main/install/install_imposter.sh | bash -

  -t, --engine-type string        Imposter engine type (valid: docker,jvm - default "docker")
  -e, --env stringArray           Explicit environment variables to set
  -h, --help                      help for up

      --mount-dir stringArray     (Docker engine type only) Extra directory bind-mounts in the form HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH (e.g. $HOME/somedir:/opt/imposter/somedir) or simply HOST_PATH, which will mount the directory at /opt/imposter/<dir>
  -p, --port int                  Port on which to listen (default 8080)
      --pull                      Force engine pull
